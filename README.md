As a mechanical engineer, I've always been fascinated by the intricate dance of forces and materials, turning theoretical designs into tangible innovations.
However, I found myself drawn to a new frontierâ€”one where data, algorithms, and insights shape the future. 
This curiosity led me to enroll in a data science bootcamp at GoMyCode, seeking to unlock new opportunities and broaden my skillset.
In this repository, you'll find the projects that chronicle my transition from the mechanical realm to the dynamic world of data science.
Each project represents a step in my journey, combining my engineering background with newfound data science skills.
From analyzing complex datasets to building predictive models, these projects showcase my growth and the endless possibilities that data science offers.
Join me as I navigate this exciting path, leveraging data to solve problems, innovate, and create a future where engineering and data science converge.
